# JPLib

Small library of Pascal units needed to compile my projects published on GitHub.

Supported Delphi versions: **2009**, **2010**, **XE**, **XE2**, **XE3**, **XE4**, **XE5**, **XE6**, **XE7**, **XE8**, **10.0 Seattle**, **10.1 Berlin**, **10.2 Tokyo**, **10.3 Rio**.  
**Lazarus**: Required FPC version **3.0.4** or newer.  
**CodeTyphon**: Tested on CodeTyphon 7.00 with FPC 3.3.1

## Installation

Installation packages for all supported IDEs can be found in the [packages](./packages) folder.
The packages are "run-time" type and do not contain any components.

The JPLib package must be installed if you want to install the [JPPack](https://github.com/jackdp/JPPack) components package. If you do not want to install JPPack, you can use JPLib without any installation.

## Hash

Some units if the [Hash](./Hash) folder uses **HashLib4Pascal** library from https://github.com/Xor-el/HashLib4Pascal and **Wolfgang Ehrhardt's** hashing units from https://github.com/jackdp/www.wolfgang-ehrhardt.de/tree/master/src/crc-hash/crc_hash

## License

The license for my work is the simplest in the world: **You can do with my code whatever you want without any cost.**

But, in some units I use code from other open source projects, so you should look at the PAS source files and license of the authors of these projects for more information.
