## Installation

Installation packages for all supported IDEs can be found in the [packages](./packages) folder.
The packages are "run-time" type and do not contain any components.

The JPLib package must be installed if you want to install the [JPPack](https://github.com/jackdp/JPPack) components package. If you do not want to install JPPack, you can use JPLib without any installation.

## Hash

Some units in the [Hash](./Hash) folder uses **HashLib4Pascal** library from <https://github.com/Xor-el/HashLib4Pascal> and **Wolfgang Ehrhardt's** hashing units from <https://github.com/jackdp/www.wolfgang-ehrhardt.de/tree/master/src/crc-hash/crc_hash>

## License

The license for my work: **Public domain**. You can do with my code whatever you want without any limitations.

But, in some units I use code from other open source projects, so you should look at the PAS source files and license of the authors of these projects for more information.
